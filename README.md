# Calculator---HTML-CSS
Online calculator made with HTML &amp; CSS.
The code starts with a tag.
The form has an id of "form1" and the action is set to calculator.html.
This tells the browser that when it loads this page, it should send all its data to calculator.html using a POST request (the method="POST").
The next line is an input field called "answer".
It has an id of "display", which will be used later on in the code for referencing this input field from other parts of the program.
Next comes a button with an onclick event handler attached to it, which calls another function named answer().
When you click on this button, it sets the value property of answer() to '' so that whatever was typed into display before clicking will not be lost when you submit your form back to calculator.html after running through all your calculations and seeing what they are worth!
The code is an example of a form that has two input fields, one for the user to enter their answer and another button.
When the button is clicked, it clears the text field.
The code above is in HTML and CSS format with a link to calculator_style.css which contains all of the styles used in this document.
The code starts with a form that has an input field for the user to enter their name.
The next line of code is a button which will add one to the value of the input field.
The next line of code is another button, this time it's an operator button and it adds two to the value of the input field.
The code is a simple form that has two input fields, one for the user's name and one for their email address.
There are also two buttons: "=" and ".".
The first button will evaluate the value of the input field with a function called eval() which returns the string representation of what is typed into it.
The second button simply changes the value of an input field to its string representation.
The code above demonstrates how to use JavaScript's built-in operators in order to perform mathematical operations on strings, as well as how to use JavaScript's built-in functions such as eval().
